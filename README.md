# Digital Clock

The Digital Clock project aims to build a simple yet functional clock that accurately shows the current time, formatted in hours, minutes, and seconds, along with an AM/PM indicator.
This project demonstrates the integration of HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality.
